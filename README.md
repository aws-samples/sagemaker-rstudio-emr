This repository is apart of the following blog:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/connect-amazon-emr-and-rstudio-on-amazon-sagemaker/. In this blog we will launch infrastructure to create an RStudio Domain and an EMR cluster. From there we will create a custom image for our SageMaker domain connecting the two.
